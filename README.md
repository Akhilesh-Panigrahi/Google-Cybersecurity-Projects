# Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate Projects

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of projects I completed as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** on Coursera. These projects demonstrate my hands-on skills in various cybersecurity domains, including security information and event management (SIEM), Python scripting, SQL, Linux, and incident response.

### 1. Update a File Through a Python Algorithm
This project involved creating a Python script to automate the process of updating an IP address allow list. The script reads from an `allow_list.txt` file, removes addresses specified in a `remove_list`, and writes the updated contents back to the file.

* **Skills Demonstrated:** Python Scripting, File I/O (reading and writing files), String & List Manipulation, Automation.

### 2. Apply Filters to SQL Queries
In this project, I performed security-related tasks by filtering a database with SQL. I wrote queries to investigate potential security incidents, such as after-hours failed login attempts and login activity from specific locations, to identify and retrieve critical information.

* **Skills Demonstrated:** SQL, Database Querying, Data Filtering (`WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`), Pattern Matching (`LIKE`).

### 3. Controls and Compliance Checklist
This project focused on assessing an organization's security posture by completing a controls and compliance checklist. I identified gaps in security controls and recommended improvements to align with compliance standards like PCI DSS and GDPR.

* **Skills Demonstrated:** Security Controls Assessment, Compliance Frameworks (PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC), Risk Assessment, Security Best Practices.

### 4. Managing File Permissions in Linux
This project involved managing file and directory permissions within a Linux environment. Using Bash commands, I adjusted permissions to ensure they aligned with organizational security policies, restricting access as needed for users, groups, and others.

* **View Project:** [**Permissions Project.pdf**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yzIpzUchL9aYNX3f0IC4NIXM0YuFC7xM/view?usp=drive_link)
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Linux Command Line, Bash Shell, File System Permissions (`chmod`, `ls -la`), User & Group Management.

### 5. Incident Report Analysis
Here, I analyzed a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack. I documented the incident and detailed the response and recovery plan according to the phases of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).

* **View Project:** [**Incident report analysis.pdf**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FUDaAN-1vGDMolOQ1rnVvHV_x20Wln74/view?usp=drive_link)
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Incident Response, DDoS Attack Analysis, Network Security, NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

### 6. Vulnerability Assessment Report
For this project, I conducted a vulnerability assessment of a database server. I performed a risk analysis based on NIST SP 800-30 guidelines, identified potential threats, and developed a remediation strategy to enhance security.

* **View Project:** [**Vulnerability assessment report.pdf**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19-ZEI5w1b9WzjIMcRgpyQYWTm9UaFyaB/view?usp=drive_link)
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Vulnerability Assessment, Risk Analysis (NIST SP 800-30), Threat Modeling, Remediation Planning.

### 7. Incident Handler's Journal
This journal documents the analysis of several simulated security incidents, including ransomware and a malicious file hash. It showcases the use of various security tools to investigate and respond to threats.

* **View Project:** [**Incident handler's journal.pdf**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tl9rGk5IL-Dp4oQ5BuKWIBtCKa9CAbJn/view?usp=drive_link)
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Incident Documentation & Analysis, Ransomware & Phishing Analysis, Security Tools (Wireshark, tcpdump, VirusTotal).
